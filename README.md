# Restricted Zone Notifier using Intel® Edge Insights(IEI) Software
In this workshop lab, we will explore Intel® Edge Insights(IEI) Software framework. By the end of the lab, you should have a solid understanding of the
the Intel® Edge Insights Software framework, how to convert python based Reference Implementation(RI) to classifier and trigger based IEI Software framework and how to deploy a RI (Here, that is Restricted Zone Notifier) using the IEI Software framework.

## How Do I Use the Lab Material
First part of Lab is to explore about the Intel® Edge Insights(IEI) Software and next how to deploy an application using this framework.
